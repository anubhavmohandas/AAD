1. Make a graph using matplotlib, we will use the inputs in sizes, (like 10, 20, 50, etc....)

2. 
Fibonacci series
produce a table (months, or years) of a table

make a graph of iteration and recursion

input should be in a range and also should be in ascending order 
implemeent sort also

according to the input count table will be generated and hence the graph will be generated.
